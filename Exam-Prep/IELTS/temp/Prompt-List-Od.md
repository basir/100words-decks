"Generate a numbered list of exactly 500 IELTS vocabulary words organized into 5 levels. Output in markdown format with level headings.

Rules for word selection:
- Exclude A1/A2 everyday words (think, know, work, live, use, show)
- Exclude overly academic/rare words unlikely in IELTS (operationalization, pellucid, truculent)
- No duplicates across any level
- Focus on Band 6.5–8.0 target vocabulary
- Prioritize words from IELTS common topics: environment, technology, health, education, economy, society, crime, urbanization, globalization

Level distribution:
- Level 1 — B1/B2 Foundation (200 words): High-frequency IELTS words every candidate must know
- Level 2 — B2/C1 Core Academic (130 words): Topic-specific academic vocabulary appearing regularly in Reading/Writing
- Level 3 — C1 High-Frequency Academic (90 words): Precise academic words with strong IELTS exam presence
- Level 4 — Band 7+ Active Vocabulary (50 words): Sophisticated words that appear in real IELTS tests, not just obscure ones
- Level 5 — Band 8+ Precision Vocabulary (30 words): Advanced words realistic for IELTS Band 8, not literary or overly rare

Output format:
- Markdown only
- Each level as a heading
- Numbered list continuing from 1 to 500 across all levels
- One word per line, number and word only, no definitions or extra text"
