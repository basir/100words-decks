## Word Selection Rules

- **Exclude** A1/A2 everyday words (e.g. think, know, work, live, use, show, get, make)
- **Exclude** overly academic or rare words unlikely to appear in IELTS (e.g. operationalization, pellucid, truculent)
- **No duplicates** across any level — check every word against the full list before including it
- **Target band**: 6.5–8.0 active vocabulary
- **Prioritize** words from IELTS high-frequency topics: environment, technology, health, education, economy, society, crime, urbanization, globalization

- Each level as a `##` heading with word range in parentheses, e.g. `## Level 1 — B1/B2 Foundation (Words 1–200)`
- Numbered list **continuing from 1 to 500** across all levels (do not restart numbering per level)

Before finalizing, verify:
1. Total word count is exactly 500
2. Level counts are exactly 200 / 130 / 90 / 50 / 30
3. No word appears more than once across all levels
4. No A1/A2 words are included
5. Numbering runs continuously from 1 to 500 with no gaps or resets
